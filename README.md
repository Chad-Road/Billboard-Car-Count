# Billboard-Car-Count
Model to count number of cars that pass billboards in a given area. Used to assess marketing value of location.

Notes: I wrote the basic structural code to run from a live video feeds to monitor for traffic buildups during road construction and alert local traffic control services (flaggers). I'm using the code here with their explicit permission, but the base code is now officially owned by Mariposa County.
